### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

Welcome to my GitHub! I'm Bryan, a third-year Mathematical, Computational, and Statistical Science student at Yale-NUS College. I love writing code to solve practical, everyday problems.

- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working through the [Neural Networks: Zero to Hero course](https://karpathy.ai/zero-to-hero.html).
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m constantly learning more about web development and exploring the latest in AI.
- ðŸ‘¯ Iâ€™m looking to collaborate on open source projects and innovative tools that leverage machine learning.
- ðŸ’¬ Feel free to ask me about Python, TypeScript, LLMs, web scraping, and automation.
- ðŸ“« Reach out to me on [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/bryan-wee-chin-wei/) if you wanna chat, or check out my work on my [personal website](https://bryanweecw.com).
- ðŸ˜„ Pronouns: He/Him
- âš¡ Fun fact: When I'm not coding, I'm probably on eBay looking for good deals on camera lenses.

Don't be a stranger â€” browse through my repositories and let's get connected!

Some projects I'm proud of:
- [A personal portfolio](https://jydoosite.vercel.app) built using NextJS for my partner.
- [A full-stack car rental app](https://smilesrental.com) for a Software Engineering Class.
- [A short demo of an interview preparation app](https://tinyurl.com/interviewappdemo) using GPT-3.5 to parse resumes and generate questions.
